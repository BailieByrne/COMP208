# Testing – Requirement Analysis

## Purpose
This document defines the testing requirements for the COMP208 project.

## Testing Objectives
- Verify that implemented features meet specified requirements
- Identify defects early in development
- Ensure system reliability and usability

## Functional Testing Requirements
The system must:
- Execute defined test cases successfully
- Validate expected outputs against actual outputs
- Handle invalid input without crashing

## Non-Functional Testing Requirements
- The system must be tested for usability
- The system must meet acceptable performance standards
- The system must demonstrate reliability over repeated tests

## Test Environment
- OS: macOS
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: GitHub

## Assumptions
- Requirements are clearly documented
- Test cases are derived from functional requirements
