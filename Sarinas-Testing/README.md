# Monte Carlo testing of the engine

Goal 

Your C++ program is like a toy car that drives once and writes predicted_prices.csv.

We want Python to say: drive 50 times, and after each drive, put the CSV into a new box:

outputs/run_0001/predicted_prices.csv

outputs/run_0002/predicted_prices.csv
