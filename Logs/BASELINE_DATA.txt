PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY BASELINE DATA
Compiled: February 24, 2026
=====================================

1. INITIAL PROFILER RESULTS (500 runs of stock_sim.exe)
=====================================================
Total Runs: 500
Total Time: 11,361ms
Average Execution Time: 23ms
Minimum Execution Time: 17ms
Maximum Execution Time: 63ms
Range: 46ms
Notes: Baseline performance without Monte Carlo optimization

2. BATCH ERROR DETECTION - WITHOUT MONTE CARLO (Single path)
===========================================================
Total Trials: 500
Average L2 Error: 356.0064
Min L2 Error: 170.9839
Max L2 Error: 677.5390
Standard Deviation: 86.9805
Notes: Single-path predictions for comparison

3. BATCH ERROR DETECTION - MONTE CARLO (500 simulations per run)
===============================================================
Total Trials: 500
Average L2 Error: 332.0830
Min L2 Error: 169.9228
Max L2 Error: 817.3169
Standard Deviation: 86.3680
Notes: Monte Carlo using 500 internal runs per prediction

4. BATCH ERROR DETECTION - THREADED MONTE CARLO
===============================================
Total Trials: 500
Average L2 Error: 247.8641
Min L2 Error: 123.3442
Max L2 Error: 520.3300
Standard Deviation: 64.0166
Notes: Threaded Monte Carlo with shared mean path update

5. COMPARISON ANALYSIS
Threaded Monte Carlo significantly improves predictive performance.
Accuracy Gains:
L2 Error Reduction: 108.14 points
Percentage Improvement: 30.37%
Stability Gains:
Std Dev Reduction: 22.96 points
Variance Reduction: 26.4%

Note to self i think there was an issue with the random gen being reused so bias crept in,
since threading i have removes this shared generator and that may have attributed to the accuracy increase.

6. VISUALIZATION
===============
Model predictions track actual stock prices well visually despite
numerical L2 errors. Predictions follow trends and volatility accurately.
